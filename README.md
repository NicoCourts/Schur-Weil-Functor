# The Schur-Weyl Functor
This paper develops the idea of the Schur-Weyl functor from representations of the Schur algebra S(n,d) to representations of the symmetric group S_d. Along the way, we develop a moinoidal structure on S(n,d)-mod following the work of Krause and show that this functor is, among other things, monoidal.
